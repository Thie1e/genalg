IMPORTANT: THIS PROJECT NEEDS A NEW MAINTAINER AND A PROPER MAILING LIST.

    I am not actively using this code myself, and (sadly) just do not have time to
    maintain it. Yet, it is clearly used a lot. If someone want to act as the next
    Dr. Who [0], please contact me. Various people already showed interest, and
    this needs organization too.
